The commissioner will check your photo ID to make sure you are who you say you are, ask you if you understand the contents of your affidavit, then ask you to swear or affirm that the contents are true. The commissioner will then watch you sign the document before signing it themselves.<br><br>Lawyers, notary publics and many court registry staff are commissioners for taking oaths. You can go to any <a href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96' target='_blank'>Provincial Court Registry</a> or <a href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FD6DB5BA2A5248038EEF54D9F9F37C4D' target='_blank'>Service BC location</a> to swear or affirm the affidavit. If you have the document sworn or affirmed at a different court registry, you will still need to file it at the court registry where the existing case is filed.<br><br>If you cannot get the document sworn or affirmed before the document is filed, the unsworn document can be filed if you will be avail­able to swear or affirm that the contents of the document are true during your court appearance."

The court usually will not consider it as evidence until this has been done.</div>"
