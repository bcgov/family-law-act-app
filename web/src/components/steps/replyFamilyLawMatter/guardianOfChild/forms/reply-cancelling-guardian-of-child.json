Only guardians can have parental responsibilities and parenting time with a child.<br><br>The <a href='https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/11025_01' target='_blank'>Family Law Act</a> provides that generally both parents will continue to be guardians even if the parents are not together, and each will have parenting time and parental responsibilities. This does not mean that parents must have equal time or responsibility for a child. An agreement or order about parenting arrangements can make all the child’s guardians share parenting responsibilities or parenting time. Or it can make only one or more guardians responsible for parenting decisions and time with the child to the exclusion of all other guardians.<br><br>In some cases, it may not be appropriate for a parent or guardian to remain a guardian. A parent can be removed as guardian by agreement with all the other guardians or by court order. If a parent is not a guardian, they can still have time with the child – contact – but will not have any parental responsibilities.<br><br>We recommend that you talk to a lawyer before you make decisions about your future parenting arrangements or guardianship of a child.",
