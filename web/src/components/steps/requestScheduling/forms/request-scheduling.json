This pathway will help you complete the Request for Scheduling Form 39.<br><br>You don’t always need to file a request for scheduling to get your next court appearance. If you were directed by the court to schedule your next appearance with a judicial case manager or together with the other party, you probably don’t need to use any form. Check with the judicial case manager (JCM) or registry staff in your court location if you are not sure. Contact information for the JCM can be found on the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/locations-contacts'>Provincial Court’s website</a> under each courthouse location. Contact information for each registry can be found <a href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
