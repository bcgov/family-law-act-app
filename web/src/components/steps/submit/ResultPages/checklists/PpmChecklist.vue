            <p>
                You normally need to give notice to the other party that you are applying for a court order. 
                You give notice by having the application documents served on the other party. The time between 
                the day that a party is served and the day that the application is heard is called the 
                "notice period" or "notice". Normally, the other party must be served with at least 7 days 
                notice of the court appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under special circumstances, the court can allow an application to be made with less than 
                7 days notice or without notice to the other party.
            </p> 

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">
                Application With Short Notice    
            </p>
            <p>
                The court may allow an application about a priority parenting matter to be made with less 
                than 7 days notice to the other party, if the situation requires a court order sooner but 
                notice should be given to the other party.
            </p>

            <p style="font-weight: 600;">
                Application Without Notice
            </p>
            <p>
                Under special circumstances, the court may allow an application about a priority parenting 
                matter may be made without notice to the other party. For example, you are concerned that 
                serious consequences will result if you notify the other party before the application is
                heard by the court.                
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to proceed without notice to the other party, you will have to satisfy the court 
                that there is a real risk of some serious consequence if the other party is given notice 
                before your application is heard. If a judge decides that your situation is urgent and the
                application can be heard without notice to the other person, the application will be heard 
                right away.
            </p>
           
            <p style="font-weight: 600;">
                If you need your order in less than 7 days or if there are special circumstances where 
                the application should proceed without notice to the other party, you must complete and file the

            <p>
                Service is the act of giving or leaving documents with the required person. It is important that 
                each other party know that a family case is going on, are aware of what step is being taken, and 
                are given a chance to tell their side of the story to the court. 
            </p>

            <p>
                You must serve the other party with at least 7 days notice of the date and time of the court 
                appearance, unless the court has ordered something else. This means there must be at least 
                7 days between the date the application documents is served on the other party and the date 
                and time of the court appearance.
            </p>
            
            <div style="margin:0;">
                An Application About Priority Parenting Matter must be served to the address of service of 
                each other party in any of the following ways::
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                  by leaving the documents at the party’s address for service
                </li>
                <li>
                    by mailing the documents by ordinary mail to the party’s address for service
                </li>
                <li>
                    by mailing the documents by registered mail to the party’s address for service
                </li>
                <li>
                    if the party’s address for service includes an email address, by emailing the 
                    documents to that email address
                </li>
                <li>
                     if the party’s address for service includes a fax number, by faxing the 
                     documents to that fax number
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                A party's address for service is the address they have provided to the court. 
                A party who does not have an address for service must be served by leaving a 
                copy of the application documents directly with the person (this is called 
                personal service). Personal service means an adult person who is at least 19, 
                other than you, must hand-deliver the documents directly to the person being 
                served. A party cannot personally serve a document on the other party.
            </p>           

            <p>
                The court may need proof you had the documents personally served. The person 
                serving the documents must complete a 
                <a

                    Certificate of Service
                </a> Form 7 so that you can prove personal service of the documents. You must 
                attach a copy of the documents to the Certificate of Service. Remember to 
                make a copy before the documents are served.
