Your evidence may come from witnesses.<br><br>A witness must have direct knowledge of the things you want them to give evidence about. The evidence must also be relevant to the issues to be decided at trial. Think about the facts you want to present to the court. Who do you need to have at the trial to tell your story. Remember, a witness can only tell the court the facts about something they saw or were involved in.<br><br>The questions in this section will help the court to understand who you plan to have as witnesses, including if a report (opinion evidence from an expert witness or trained professional) has been ordered, completed, and if the writer may be required to attend the trial.",
